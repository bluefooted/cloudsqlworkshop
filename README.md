Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on *The Cloud Workshop for the SQL Professional*.

In this course you will learn how to solve modern data challenges with Azure SQL using a hands-on lab approach.

This course is intended to be taken as a self-paced or instructor-led workshop. A supplement slide deck is available for this course in the [slides](https://github.com/microsoft/cloudworkshop/tree/master/cloudworkshop/slides) folder.

This course is designed for data professionals who have a basic working knowledge of SQL Server and the T-SQL language.

<b>     Setup</b></h3>

This workshop is broken up into several modules than can all be taken together or in groups:

- Modules 1 and 2 are fundamentals about **Azure and Azure SQL** but have no hands-on exercises. You can review the materials in the supplied presentation. It is highly recommend to review these module slides before working on the hands-on exercises for the rest of the modules.
- Modules 3 and 4 are about **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines** and designed to be completed together.
- Modules 5 and 6 are about **Azure SQL Managed Instance** and designed to be taken together.
- Module 7 is about **Azure SQL Database** can be taken independently from other modules.

In order to complete the exercises in this workshop you will need the following:

- Download the lab files from https://aka.ms/cloudsqlworkshopfiles for all modules
- You will need an Azure subscription that has Azure Role-Based Control (RBAC) rights and resource quotas to deploy Azure Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Managed Instances, and Azure SQL Database depending on what modules you complete.
- You will need rights to deploy a SQL Server 2022 virtual machine from the marketplace for Modules 3 and 4. You can use Developer Edition to save costs.
- Module 7 requires the ability to use an additional Microsoft Entra ID account but you can skip that exercise in that module if you don't have this.
