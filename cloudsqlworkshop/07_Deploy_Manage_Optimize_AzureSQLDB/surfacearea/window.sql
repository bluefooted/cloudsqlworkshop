-- Credtis to Sharanya Bhat for providing this example demo
-- If you don't have AdventureWorks2022 just read the example to see query differences
USE AdventureWorks2012;
GO

-- Without the WINDOW clause

    ,SUM(OrderQty) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderID ORDER BY SalesOrderID, ProductID ) AS Total

    ,COUNT(OrderQty) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderID ORDER BY SalesOrderID, ProductID) AS "Count"

WHERE SalesOrderID IN(43659,43664);
