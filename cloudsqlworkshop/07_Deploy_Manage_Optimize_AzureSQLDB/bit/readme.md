# Exercises for bit manipulation T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2022

Follow these steps for exercises for bit manipulation functions in SQL Server 2022

## Prerequisites

- SQL Server 2022 Evaluation or Developer Edition
- VM or computer with 2 CPUs and at least 8Gb RAM.
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The latest 18.x build or 19.x build will work.

##  Steps to run the exercises

1. Execute the script **getbits.sql** to see how the BIT_COUNT() AND GET_BIT() functions work.
1. Execute the script **packbits.sql** to see how the RIGHT_SHIFT() and LEFT_SHIFT() and SET_BIT functions work. 

    > **Note** in the scripts you will sometimes see the LEFT_SHIFT() AND << in back to back statements. The same for RIGHT_SHIFT() AND >>. This is just to demonstrate two ways of doing the same thing.
